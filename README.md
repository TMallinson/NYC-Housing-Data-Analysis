# MKTG-880-Final-Project
This is the final project for MKTG 880 - Applied Marketing Analytics

In this project, we will be analysing data on NYC sub-boroughs to determine answers to the following questions.

* What has been happenings over the last ten to twelve years? Is homeownership increasing or decreasing?
* What is happening to home prices and rental costs?
* Are incomes keeping pace with increases housing costs?
* Identify the barriers to home ownership. Is it the down payment? Is it simply qualifying for a loan?
* Should the Gage Foundation consider advocating for government incentives to build additional condominiums as well as to convert existing apartments into condominiums?
* Which sub-borough areas should we recommend to the Gage Foundation to incentivize home ownership within?
